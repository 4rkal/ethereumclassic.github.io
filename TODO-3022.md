# Prose

A rock solid rather ETC's foundation is better than ETH's; it is rock solid.

- "When ETC reaches ETH's current network vlaue, it will be worth 100x it's current value"

Target Audience

- Newbies
- Investors

## Landing Page

- Welcome
- ETC is special; the longest running uninterrupted smart contract platform
- Not on many people's radar, but has wild potential
- We want to tell you why

## Why Classic

- By now you probably know a little about Ethereum
- ETC is longest runnin smart

### Elevator Pitch

- ETH moving to PoS
- ETC will be the only PoW smart contract platform
- ETC has full compatibility with ETH, meaning contracts can be easily deployed

- Like kansean economics, ETH sacrificed decentralization for short term financial interests. In the long run, ETC will be the real benefactor

### Genesis

- Ethereum Classic loves Etheruem, Etheruem Classic IS Ethereum
- The Original Ethereum Vision
  - Show the original website of etheruem
- The DAO
- The Bailout

### Code is Law

- Cypherpunk
- Disintermediation
- A New Renaissance whereby society is goverened by uncorruptable logic
- Like Bitcoin's money, Ethereum's law will being with parralel institutions but will eventually envelop due to it's efficiency and elimination of rent seeking middlemen and institutions

### Decentralization

- Proof of work
- Meatspace Capture
- No Satoshi, No Vitalik
- Protocol Neutrality

### Sound Money

- Time preference
- Incentive structures of pure math
- ETC is money

### Free

- Benefits of

## Philosophy

### Elevator Pitch

-
- ETC is better than ETH
-

### Genesis

If you are reading this you are probably already somewhat familiar with Ethereum, the wildly popular blockchain and Smart Contract platform that has become synoimous with the concept of "programmable money". The original version of Ethereum, launched in 2015, had a clear mission: to provide a platform that allows developers to "Build Unstoppable Applications".

The founders of Ethereum prostletized the idea of _Code is Law_. A promising vision for the future where contracts between individuals and organizations could be guaunteed not by corruptible and rent-seeking middlemen but by cold hard logic that is impossible to be manipulated by legacy interests; it's not "don't be evil", it's "can't be evil".

But just over a year after launching, something went terribly wrong. We will cover this debacle in detail later, but long story short(link),
TODO abit about the DAO.

a signficiant portion of the 2016 Etheruem community, including the majority of it's leadership, decided to abondon the idea of unstoppability, code is law, and the promising future it enabled.

But hope was not lost. A small and coregious contingent of philosophers, developers, miners and shitposters decided to prove to the world that unstoppability was just that -- unstoppable, and could not just be forked away on a whim. If the main Ethereum project was unable to keep the promises it made, then those promises would be kept on their behalf under the name "Ethereum Classic".

What happened next was a miracle, the effects of which will ripple throughout the pages of history for millenia to come.

....

The immaculate conception of Ethereum Classic not only proved to the world that Code is Law would live on, but it refined, concentrated and formalized the philosophy of "Build Unstoppable Appplications" into a well defined ....

Supporters of Etheruem Classic support the Original Ethereum Vision, and

Ethereum Classic exists to protect and continue that original vision.

But something went wrong, and little over a year after it's launch, the majority of the Ethereum community abandoned that mission.

The Etheruem you know today that has gained such incredible popularity

But did you know that there exists a version of Ethereum that has been continuously operating for _over a year longer_ than Ethereum.

Moreover, this original of Ethereum, who's foundation drills deeply into the economic and game

Money

Did you know that this older chain
