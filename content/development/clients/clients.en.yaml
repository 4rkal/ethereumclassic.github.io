    description: Fast and feature-rich multi-network Ethereum client. For Phoenix upgrade support, please use version v3.0.1 or later. Upgrade considerations, ParityEthereum is no longer being maintained by Parity Technologies and was handed over to Gnosis as the OpenEthereum project. Shortly later the OpenEthereum project announced intent to deprecate ETC support and an ETC participant forked the OpenEthereum repository to OpenETC. This client is community maintained.
