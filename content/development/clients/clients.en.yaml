    description: Core-Geth is a distribution of go-ethereum with many flavors. For Phoenix upgrade support, please use version v1.11.0 or later.

    key: Hyperledger Besu
    name: Hyperledger Besu
    link: https://besu.hyperledger.org/
    description: Hyperledger Besu is an Ethereum client designed to be enterprise-friendly for both public and private permissioned network use cases. For Phoenix upgrade support, please use version 1.4.6-RC2 or later. Upgrade considerations, APIs between ParityEthereum and Besu significantly differ and mining is not very well supported in Besu at this moment. This client is Long Term Supported by the ChainSafe and ETC Cooperative teams as part of the Hyperledger project with stable funding from Grayscale's Ethereum Classic Trust. This is a recommended client from a well-known transparent team.

    name: OpenETC
    link: https://github.com/openetc
    description: OpenETC is a fast and feature-rich multi-network Ethereum client. For Phoenix upgrade support, please use version 3.0.1 or later. Upgrade considerations, OpenETC is a branch of the deprecated ParityEthereum project. Users can use their existing data directories and do not need to resync for migration to OpenETC from the deprecated ParityEthereum v2.7.2 client. OpenETC is an open source, community maintained branch of the ParityEthereum client. Note this client project is marked as an experimental client due to its infancy. The open development team lacks a known track record of development due to their anonymous nature. Please do your own research if you intend to use this client.
