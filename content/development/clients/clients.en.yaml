    description: Hyperledger Besu is an Ethereum client designed to be enterprise-friendly for both public and private permissioned network use cases.

Upgrade considerations, APIs between ParityEthereum and Besu significantly differ and mining is not very well supported in Besu at this moment.

This is a recommended client from a well-known transparent team.
