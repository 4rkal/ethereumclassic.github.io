      developer:
        question: Do I need to be a developer to contribute to Ethereum Classic?
        answer: No. While developers provide critical value in building infrastrucutre, an arguably more important role is played by non-developers, who help in other ways, by coordinating and helping to spread the word of Ethereum Classic, in turn recruiting developers and other recruiters.
      channels:
        question: How can I join the ETC community?
        answer: You don't need to ask for permission to join. Just start contributing!
      tasks:
        question: What tasks can I help with?
        answer: A list of things that need doing is maintained in the [Ethereum Classic Volunteer GitHub repository](https://github.com/ethereumclassic/volunteer).
      where:
        question: Where do Ethereum Classic supporters mostly hang out?

      ecips:
        question: How can I suggest improvements to Ethereum Classic?
        answer: To suggest protocol upgrades, you can use the Ethereum Classic Improvement Proposal process, but it's worth brainstorming with other community members in one of the ETC [Social Channels](/community/channels) first.
      toxicity:
        question: I heard that the ETC community is toxic. Is that true?
        answer: |
          Because nobody needs permission to be part of the ETC community, it attracts all kinds of characters, from nice to, on occasion, less nice. 

          If you'd prefer a more moderated experience, try the [ETC Coop Discord](https://discord.gg/5wDyd6u6pU), which enforces stricter rules around politeness of interpersonal communication.
      events:
        question: Are there any Ethereum Classic events?
        answer: Yes. You can find out more about present, past and future events in the events section.
      website:
        question: How can I add my App, Video or Article to to this website?

      tweets:
        question: How can I suggest tweets?
        answer: The [`@eth_classic`](https://github.com/ethereumclassic/tweets-eth_classic) and [`@ETH_Network`](https://github.com/ethereumclassic/tweets-etc_network) Twitter accounts accept community suggested tweets. Simply tweet your suggested tweet with the hashtag `#ETCtweets`, and it will be reviewed by the community in the `#ETCTweets` Discord thread.
