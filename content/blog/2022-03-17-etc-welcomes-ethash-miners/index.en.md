# Ethash Miners: Welcome to ETC

## ETChash Mining on Ethereum Classic
[Proof of Work Commitment](https://ethereumclassic.org/why-classic/proof-of-work)

By way of Core Developer Call 22, the Ethereum Classic network publicly signals continued support for the ETChash mining algorithm through the foreseeable future. This reaffirms Ethereum Classic's principles of fostering a decentralized Proof of Work mining ecosystem. This confirms a continued long-term commitment to the current mining ecosystem participants and their GPU and ETChash ASIC equipment. Thank you for securing the original Ethereum chain, Ethereum Classic.

## Welcome Disenfranchised Ethash Miners

The Ethereum Foundation is expected to migrate it's EVM network to proof of stake consensus in Quarter 2 of 2022 through an event labeled "[The Merge](https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/merge/)".

This Merge event will disenfranchise the largest EVM's Proof of Work mining ecosystem. Ethereum Classic is well positioned to absorb much of this abandoned Ethash hashrate.

However, Ethash miners might not realize that Ethereum Classic operates a modified version of Ethash called ETChash. This mining algorithm was put in place via the [Thanos Upgrade](https://ethereumclassic.org/blog/2020-11-27-thanos-hard-fork-upgrade) in November 2020.

New ETChash miners will find comfort in knowing that Ethereum Classic made a long-term commitment to [Proof of Work consensus](https://ethereumclassic.org/why-classic/proof-of-work) through the network's [Die Hard Upgrade](http://ecips.ethereumclassic.org/ECIPs/ecip-1041) in 2018.

If you're new to ETC mining ecosystem, you've found a long-term home in the Ethereum Classic network where you can properly plan your Capex / Opex around a stable network with a [predictable monetary policy](https://ethereumclassic.org/why-classic/sound-money). Thank you for securing the original Ethereum chain, Ethereum Classic.

## ETC Fixed Monetary Policy

New mining participants on the Ethereum Classic network may want to familiarize themselves with ETC's fixed monetary policy and the [5M20 emission schedule](https://ethereumclassic.org/why-classic/sound-money) via [ECIP-1017](https://ecips.ethereumclassic.org/ECIPs/ecip-1017). A great countdown for the 5M20 emission schedule can be found at [ETCis.money](https://etcis.money).
