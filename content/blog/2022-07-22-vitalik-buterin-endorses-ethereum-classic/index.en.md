# EthCC[5] Talk: Vitalik Buterin Endorses Ethereum Classic as Proof of Work EVM

The Ethereum Foundation nears its soft date of September 19, 2022 for the network's migration to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. In a clip capture by Donald McIntyre of [EtherPlan](https://ethereplan.com), Ethereum's most prominent co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, gave an endorsement of the original Ethereum network, Ethereum Classic. This endorsement was offered as a reasonable solution to those in the ETH crowd that were not thrilled with the idea of the Ethereum Foundation's chain migrating to Proof-of-Stake.

> Who here wants to cancel Proof of Stake?...There are plenty of blockchains, like there is Ethereum Classic, which is the original Ethereum which did not betray the vision by forking TheDAO. It's a very welcoming community and I think they'll definitely welcome Proof of Work fans...If you like Proof of Work, you should go use Ethereum Classic. It's a totally fine chain.
