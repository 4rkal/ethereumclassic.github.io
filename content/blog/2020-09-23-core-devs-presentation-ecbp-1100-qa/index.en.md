### ECBP-1100 Modified Exponential Subjective Scoring Presentation

ETC Labs Core, in consultancy with OpenRelay and ChainSafe, develop and propose a finality algorithm called MESS for Ethereum Classic that, if adopted by the honest majority, would raise chain state finality near-exponentially with negligible risk of network bifurcation.

* Overview "Artificial Finality" and non-invasive 51-percent-protection
* Quick explanation of the "MESS" protocol (ECIP-1100)
* LIVE Demo on the MESS testnet using Geth
* Community Q&A session

### Goals

Following the recommendations of representatives of other teams (mostly IOHK) and requests from community members, we decided to organize a live Q&A session. The goal of this call is to get contributors, community members, stakeholders and other teams who have created similar proposals to ask questions as needed to properly understand this proposal.

### Q&A

Questions must be submitted to this [issue comment thread](https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/issues/374) or directly at ETC Discord.
