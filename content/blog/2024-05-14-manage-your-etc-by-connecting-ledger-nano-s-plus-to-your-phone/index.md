Ledger Nano S Plus is a hardware wallet, so to use it with your phone you need to have your Ledger Nano S Plus device, the Ledger Live app on your computer as we explained in a [previous guide](https://ethereumclassic.org/blog/2024-02-27-using-the-ledger-nano-s-plus-with-ethereum-classic), and the Ledger Live app on your phone.

In this tutorial we will explain how to manage your ETC by connecting your Ledger Nano S Plus to your phone.

We will show the parallel actions between your devices where appropriate.

## Associate Ledger Live With iPhone

To manage your ETC with your iPhone, you will need your Ledger Nano S Plus hardware device and your Ledger Live app on your computer. For now it's not possible to connect a Ledger Nano S Plus to an iPhone directly, but it is possible to associate your Ledger Live apps on your computer and iPhone.

To begin, download Ledger Live on your iPhone and open it. Then, select “Access your wallet”, and in the next screen select “Synch with Ledger Live desktop”.  After these steps, see the instructions in the following screen. 

### 2. Associate Ledger Live Desktop to Your iPhone

To associate your Ledger Live desktop to your iPhone, open it and go to “Settings”, then “Accounts”, and then to “Accounts export”. In the next screen you will see a dynamic QR code.

On your Ledger Live on your iPhone, click on the “I’m ready to scan” button. Then, scan the dynamic QR code on your computer screen.

### 3. Select the Accounts You Wish to Synchronize
