# 5M20 Era 4 Fifthening: ETC Nears Bitcoin inspired Block Reward Reduction

![5M20 is Ethereum Classic's Monetary Policy](./etc-5m20.png)

[Ethereum Classic](https://ethereumclassic.org/why-classic) is the original Ethereum network launched in 2015. One of ETC's favorable properties, is its 5M20 monetary policy which features a fixed supply and known emission schedule via [ECIP-1017](https://ecips.ethereumclassic.org/ECIPs/ecip-1017). The fixed supply of Ethereum Classic is 210,700,000 ETC. The emission schedule is a block reward reduction of 20% every 5,000,000 blocks. A visual countdown and chart of the 5M20 emission schedule can be found at [ETCis.Money](https://etcis.money).

Around the end of April, 2022 the Ethereum Classic network is expected to hit the 15,000,000 block and enter the fourth era of the 5M20 emission schedule. This will result in a decrease of block rewards from 3.2 ETC to 2.56 ETC per block. This reduces the sell side liquidity provided to miners for securing the network via the [Proof of Work](https://ethereumclassic.org/why-classic/proof-of-work) consensus mechanism. The table below shows the block reduction amounts and the total ETC emitted to miners during each 5M20 Era.

## ETC is Sound Money

The 5M20 emission schedule was inspired by Bitcoin. However the ~2.3 year "fifthening" event for ETC is quicker than Bitcoin's 4 year "halvening" event. Also, the 5M20 schedule is a bit smoother with 20% reductions compared to Bitcoins 50% reduction. The result is a decrease in the inflation on Ethereum Classic at a quicker rate than Bitcoin.

ETC is [sound money](https://ethereumclassic.org/why-classic/sound-money) built on top of the largest [Proof of Work](https://ethereumclassic.org/why-classic/proof-of-work) smart contract blockchain. If Bitcoin is "Plan B." Ethereum Classic is "Plan C."

> But some, like yourself, decide to dive a little deeper, and they discover some interesting facts that debunk that initial skepticism. Their journey down the rabbit hole begins when they find out that Ethereum Classic is not a clone of Ethereumâ„¢, but a continuation of the original Ethereum launched in 2015, which The Ethereum Foundation forked away from by launching a new protocol one year later in 2016.
