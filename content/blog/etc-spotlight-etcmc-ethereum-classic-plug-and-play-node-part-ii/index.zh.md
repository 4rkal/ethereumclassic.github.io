We asked him the following questions: 

- What is your background? 
- Please describe the ETCMC product 
- Once you buy it, how do you set it up? 
- What is the ETCMC DAO? 
- What is the ETCPOW token? 
- How many ETCMC nodes are running right now in the ETC network? 

In addition to the above, Seth explained the whole business model of ETCMC and how the ETCMC DOA will work, including the distribution of funds to token holders. 

35% of income will go to platform development, 30% to an investment fund that will finance projects on ETC, and 35% will be distributed as dividends to ETCPOW token owners. 

He also explained that ETCMC will operate a mining pool as well as a mining farm dedicated to ETC.
