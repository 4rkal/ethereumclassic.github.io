  title: Build Unstoppable Applications
  content: |
    As incumbent institutions become increasingly threatened by cryptocurrency, only the truly decentralized blockchains will survive. 

    Existing in response to the censorship of contracts on sister chain Ethereum, Classic has proven its ability to resist censorship against all the odds and to deliver the *The Original Ethereum Vision* of *unstoppable* applications.

    By combining the technology of ETH with the philosophy of BTC, ETC is uniquely positioned to provide utility in a future where other chains are destroyed or captured by special interests. 

    Welcome, and please be invited to discover ETC's past, present and future, it's principles, value proposition, community, and more; to understand *why Classic*.
