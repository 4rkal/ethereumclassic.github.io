    Welcome, and thank you for taking a closer look at Ethereum Classsic, the understated and sagacious elder sister of the Ethereum family. 

    If you are here, you are probably already somewhat familiar with the wildly popular Smart Contract platform known as [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org), but did you know that ETC has been been faithfully operating for over a year longer than ETH?

    This website aims to help you, dear reader, wrap your noggin around the signficance and importance of ETC and how it upholds the reality-mending elixer of **code is law**.
