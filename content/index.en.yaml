  title: Build Unstoppable Applications
  content: |
    As incumbent institutions are increasingly threatened by the wild potential of blockchain technology, only the truly decentralized cryptocurrencies will survive. 

    Existing in response to the censorship of contracts on sister chain Ethereum, Classic has proven its ability to resist censorship against all the odds and to deliver the *The Original Ethereum Vision* of *unstoppable* applications.

    By combining the technology of ETH with the philosophy of BTC, ETC is uniquely positioned to provide utility as the Smart Contract Platform of the future, as other chains are compromised and captured by special interests. 

    Welcome, and please be invited to discover ETC's past, present and future, it's principles, value proposition, community, and more; to understand *why Classic*.
