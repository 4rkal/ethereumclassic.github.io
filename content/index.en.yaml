    THIS IS NOT ACTUALLY GOING TOBE USED 

    Welcome, and thank you for taking a closer look at Ethereum Classsic, the understated and sagacious elder sister of the Ethereum family. 

    If you are here, you are probably already somewhat familiar with the wildly popular Smart Contract platform known as [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org), but did you know that ETC has been been faithfully operating for over a year longer than ETH?

    Today, for those who understand why, Ethereum Classic represents a diamond in the rough in a crowded Cryptocurrency space; it is one of the preciously scarse *maxmilally decentralized* projects, making it uniquley fit to serve the future of humanity in an uncorruptable, neutral and censorship resitant way. Because of this Ethereum Classic has a future potential that is far beyond most relatively centralized cryptocurrency projects; it will outlive and outshine nearly all of them in time. 

    This website aims to help you, dear reader, wrap your noggin around the signficance and importance of ETC and how it upholds the reality-mending elixer of **code is law**.
