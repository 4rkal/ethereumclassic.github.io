description: |
  Ethereum Classic presents a unique investment opportunity as it is one of the few truly neutral blockchain projects; the protocol treats all participants equally. This means that if you purchase ETC, you are contributing directly to the security of the network, and there is no central organization that disproportionately benefits from this contribution. 

  On chains that have an undiluted premine and/or a dev team that receives a portion of the block reward, not only is your contribution is essentially taxed by this group, but it is diverted away from network security, either directly away from miners or in the form of negative price pressure as value is liquidated to pay for this group's expenses.

  Ethereum Classic, thanks to the [ultrafair redistribution](/why-classic/genesis#free-money-and-the-ultrafair-redistribution), does not have a central organization that is continually liquidating their premine, which pushes the price down at the expense of holders. Moreover, as with Bitcoin, ETC has a known future supply rather than one that can be inflated away at the whim of an opaque organizing committee, which redistributes value away from holders.  

  The following materials discuss key theses and relevant information, aimed at investors and those who are looking to understand the upside potential and value proposition of ETC.
