title: The Ethereum Classic Foundation
seo: An explanation of why blockchains that have a Foundation based on ideas and principles are far more powerful than those that are made of people.

The Ethereum Classic Foundation does not consist of people; it is an idea.

As an idea, ETC's Foundation is immune from many forms of attack; it is rhobust and can stand the test of time. Comapred to other projects that are guided by corruptible centralized institutions, The Ethereum Classic Foundation is itself a set of principles designed to maximise the longevity of the project.

There is no top-down control over Ethereum Classic, and this antifragility is acheived by participants maintaining and refining a doctrine of decentralization that can be easily articulated, understood, and perpetuated over time.

For Etheruem Classic, it's Foundation is it's strongest and most important element. ETC exists in recognition of the fact that all of a blockchain's utilty and value is ultimately downstream of principles, which through the continuous persuit of decentralization maximalism, can prevent outside forces from capturing a chain and overruling _Code is Law_.
