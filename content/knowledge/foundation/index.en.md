The Ethereum Classic Foundation does not consist of people; it is an idea.

As an idea, ETC's Foundation is immune from many forms of attack; it is robust and can stand the test of time. Compared to other projects that are guided by corruptible centralized institutions, The Ethereum Classic Foundation is itself a set of principles designed to maximize the longevity of the project and prevent it from being captured.

There is no top-down control over Ethereum Classic, which leads to an [antifragility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifragility), and is achieved by participants maintaining and refining a doctrine of decentralization that can be easily articulated, understood, and perpetuated over time.

For Ethereum Classic, its Foundation is its strongest and most important element. ETC exists in recognition of the fact that all of a blockchain's utility and value is ultimately downstream of principles, which through the continuous pursuit of _decentralization maximalism_, can prevent outside forces from compromising a chain and overruling _Code is Law_.
