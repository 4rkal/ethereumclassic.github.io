## What is Ethereum Classic (ETC)?

Ethereum Classic is a decentralized blockchain platform that lets anyone build and use decentralized applications that run on blockchain technology. Like Bitcoin, no one controls or owns Ethereum Classic â€“ it is an open-source project built by people around the world. Unlike the Bitcoin protocol, Ethereum Classic was designed to be adaptable and flexible. It is easy to create new applications on the Ethereum Classic platform.

In 2014, Ethereum founders Vitalik Buterin, Gavin Wood and Jeffrey Wilcke began work on a next-generation blockchain that had the ambitions to implement a general, fully trustless smart contract platform. [What is Ethereum?](https://ethereum.org/what-is-ethereum/)

In 2016, after a [controversial hard fork](/knowledge/roadmap), Ethereum mainline spawned a new network with new consensus rules. Ethereum Classic continued following the original network rules and has maintained the original Ethereum vision ever since.

Ethereum Classic aka **ETC** aka has a number of meanings depending on usage:

- Broadly, ETC refers to the Ethereum Classic Network, including the blockchain itself and the wider ecosystem and community
- ETC also refers to the *native currency*, or *base token* of the Ethereum Classic Blockchain, commonly traded under the ETC ticker symbol on exchanges
- In a technical context, ETC is also known as Ether or Wei

ETC is "digital money" that can be sent over the internet instantly and cheaply, and also be used in Ethereum Classic applications.

## How do I get ETC?

### Purchase ETC

The easiest way to get ETC is to buy some. There are many cryptocurrency exchanges that will allow you to buy ETC, but the one you should use will depend on where you live and how you want to pay.

For more information on where to buy ETC check this non-exhaustive list of [exchanges](/ecosystem/exchanges).

### Mining for ETC

More technically advanced users may acquire ETC by allocating computer resources to support the Ethereum Classic network. This method is commonly referred to as "mining" for block rewards. Mining is competitive and requires advanced knowledge that we will not cover here, but here is a list of [mining resources](/development/mining-resources).

### Earn ETC

You can also exchange goods or services for ETC. One way of earning ETC is to become a [developer](/development) and build your very own Ethereum Classic applications.
