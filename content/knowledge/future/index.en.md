title: Future Classic
description: An overview of Ethereum Classic's origins, history and future development roadmap
---

As of writing at the beginning of 2022, Ethereum Classic sits well positioned for it's next stage of growth. Unlike other projects, Ethereum Classic does not have a central organizing comittee calling the shots, so similar to Bitcoin, what gets implemented in the protocol is determined through an organic, meritocratic, emergent system.

This means that there ETC, like Bitcoin, does not have a "Roadmap" in the traditional sense, but rather a process that allows good features to be implemented if and when they come along and are approved by the community.

This process will be outlined here, including some of the potential future upgrades currently being discussed that on the horizon for ETC.

## Move Slowly & Don't Break Things

Typically, the implementation of new features requires overwealming support (or at least, no significant contention) from the Ethereum Classic community, making ETC, like BTC, fairly cautious in it's technological development.

Rather than a "move fast and break things" mentality, which can cause financial harm if things go wrong, significant updates are typically mulled, refined and tested over long periods before being implemented into the main network.

Additionally, care is taken to ensure that, as much as possible, contracts that were deployed as far back in 2015 can faithfully operate in perpetuity, and that _Code is Law_ is maintained.

This does not mean that ETC is unable to innovate opportunistically. One such example is the [Thanos fork](/knowledge/forks#thanos), which took advantage of Ethereum's increasing DAG size in order to sweep up security by allowing an otherwise abandoned category of GPU to mine ETC, which was an easy win-win upgrade for Ethereum Classic.

## Etheruem as a Testnet

One advantage of this approach is that Ethereum Classic can stand by whilst watching other chains take on the risk of implementing new features, and only after they have shown to be safe and effective, good features can be implemented with minimal risk or development effort.

In this way, other EVM chains can be seen as incentivised Testnets of Etheruem Classic, with much more rigorous testing than a traditional Testnet could provide.

## ECIPs

The [Ethereum Classic Improvement Proposal (ECIP) process](/development/ecips) is the main way that upgrades for Ethereum Classic are discussed, and are rigorously vetted by it's developer community. This process is completely open, and anyone can contribute by drafting an ECIP that may one day be included in Ethereum Classic.
