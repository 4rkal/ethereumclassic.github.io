Ethereum Classic, despite having no central organizing committee, has managed to attract all kinds of players at various points in time who have come and gone and all contributed and shaped it in their own way. ETC's greatest strength, it's philosophy and principles, are able to be spread even without billions of dollars of marketing because their value is self evident and bright minds gravitate toward them.

There is no way to compete traditionally with a billion dollar budget VC chain in the short term; those projects are sure to attract immediate attention. But as the good word of Ethereum Classic is spread, and people get deeper into understanding the value of blockchain, ETC is going to keep delivering on the Original Ethereum Vision of "Build Unstoppable Applications" and will become quietly, steadily but inevitably more valuable, without a central marketing budget in sight.

This section contains a selection of contributions from community members that feed into the source of ETC's strength, by providing intel and philosophical ordinance that can be deployed in the battle of winning hearts and minds.
