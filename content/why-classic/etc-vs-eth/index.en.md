## A House Built on Sand

> Everyone then who hears these words of mine and does them will be like a wise man who built his house on the rock. And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat on that house, but it did not fall, because it had been founded on the rock. And everyone who hears these words of mine and does not do them will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand. And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it fell, and great was the fall of it.

The house built on sand didn't need to take time to prepare it's foundation; instead, it built fast and big, using it's head start to construct a grand exterior. The house built on rock took it's time to drill down and anchor itself to strong foundations first, which took longer, so it was a modest but functional structure. But a storm is coming, and things are about to get very windy. So which house do you wish to take shelter in?

Ethereum Classic maintains compatibility with Etheruem Smart Contracts, so developers can deploy them to Classic with zero effort.

## Differences

### Philosophy

Code is Law

### Monetary Policy

Todo, explain stuff.

> ETC is a hedge against ETH's transition to Proof of Stake not going to plan
