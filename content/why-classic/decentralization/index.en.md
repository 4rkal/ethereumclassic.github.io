## What does Decentralization acutall mean?

- Recap on Code is Law & Genesis
- Decentralization Spectrum
- Sovereign Grade
- Censhorship Resistence
- Decentrlisation Maximalism
- Eutopia, Unstoppability / Code is Law
- Maintaining _Code is Law_ is what gives blockchains value

The onyl way to achieve this is to follow the original ethereum vision of unstoppabile - truly unstobble - applications that are reistant to censorship from any force.

Today, even more so than 2015, it's increasingly obvious that Censorship is becoming the weapon of choice and will be weilded to protect a dying system

## Why is Decentralization Necesasry?

- Longevity
- Protocol Neutrality
- Short vs Long Term Time Preference
- Centralization Gravity Well
- Benefits of Centralization are obvious
- Natural vs Artificial Contribution
- Principles over Pragmatism? au contraire!
- Competition for the Neutrality Niche
- The Centralization Gravity Well

In the long run, only truly decentralized blockchains will survive.

Small infractions or exceptions are intolorable as they will accumulate over time until the system becomes captured

## What Happens if you don't have it?

- Meatspace Capture
- Reguatory Risk
- Corporate Capture, Consensys, Metamask(?)
- Kompromat
- The Ephemeral Foundation
- Parable of built house on Rock vs Sand
- Proof of Stake chains are not serious about decentralization maximalism
- Proof of Stake Security Trade-Off

  - Rich get richer
  - Nothing at Stake
  - No Dispute Resolution via Chain Split
  - Permissioned

Matthew 7:24-27

24 “Everyone then who hears these words of mine and does them will be like a wise man who built his house on the rock. 25 And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat on that house, but it did not fall, because it had been founded on the rock. 26 And everyone who hears these words of mine and does not do them will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand. 27 And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it fell, and great was the fall of it.”

As time goes on and the full scope of blockchain technology becomes apparent, incumbant institutions will do everything within their power to subvert and destroy the new systems that threatern to disintermediate them.

Technological, Economic and Social attacks will be launched against the cryptocurrency space and will be effective against the majority of chains that have failed to anticipate this threat. Ironically, the very reason for blockchains existing is forgotten by the majority of them today, as they abandon the countermeasures that Satoshi Nakamoto handed down.

Let's imagine that one day you happen to be in charge of .

Ask yourself how you'd take down a chain like Ethereum.

Here's a thought experiment. Imagine it's

## How do you maintain Decentralization?

- Maintaining Code is Law is not easy
- Requires decentralization maximalism
- ETC x BTC = ETC
- We take the best parts of bitcoin and apply them to the best parts of Ethereum
- Technologically and/or Philosophically superior to both projects
- ETH: Smart Contract Platform -- Turing Complete, Built for Developers
- BTC: Fundamentals of Decentralization and Sound Money
- ETC has a "foudnation", but has not that kind.
- ETC possibly embodies the principles of bitcoin in a more explicit way
- ETC has no satsohi
- Pillars of decentralization
  - Proof of Work
    - Miner Attrition
    - Permissionless
    - Fair Distribution
    - Battle Tested
    - Simple, Less Attack Surface
    - Separation of Responsibilities
  - Principles
  - Philosophical, Social, Proof of Work, etc
  - Sound Money
  - Ultrafair Distribution
  - No Leaders

Just like Bitcoin, the only real way to get around this problem is to have no no leaders.

How do we prevent this from happening in ETC? by defending our principles.

The fight for Code is Law, upheld by decentralization, is not over - it never will be over - as these values must be continually spread, nurtured, evolved and reinforced.

Ethereum Classic didn't just have a "fair distribution", it had an "ultrafair distribution"; a voluntary market redistribution away from those who didn't want Code is Law to those who supported Code is Law; this process refined the initial hodlers of ETC to be those who would respect and defend it's core values.

## Conclusion

- ETH is already captured, see: The DAO
- We are just waiting for that capturedness to express itself again

Reasoning from first principles, we arrive at the conclusion that Ethereum Classic is currently humanity's best bet, the rest will succumb to outside pressure, which will exploit any points of centralization

In the the not too distant future, the need for will be all too clear. As blockchain projects one by one reveal their true colors and succum to corruption in the form of capture by special interests, only the truly decentralized will remain.
