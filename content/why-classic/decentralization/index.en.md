Since the stormy days of The DAO Fork, Ethereum Classic has persisted and it's community has coaleased around a number ideas, with the most fundamental but difficult to pin down being _decentralization_.

This series of buzzwords is actually a recipie for unlocking the value potential of blockchain technology; first you need decentralization, which enables immutability, which in turn enables unstoppability, making possible the [bright future](/why-classic/code-is-law) we discussed earlier.

This section will attempt to lay out the case for decentralization; the what, why, and how of an illusive but vital ingreedient that is the key to reaching the next level of civilization.

## Quantifying Decentralization

Decentralization is a property that exists in many systems and in many forms throughout nature. It is not a binary property, but a spectrum, that ebbs and flows through time. It's difficult to articulate a hard and fast definition for _decentralization_ in all contexts, but it can be visually understood fairly intuitively.

-- image of decentralization --

In the realm of blockchain projects, there are many ways of measuring decentralization, with one rough quantification being "The ratio of people needed to be compromised in order to take over the system". That is to say, if an attacker wanted to control or censor a chain, a project that required them to compromise 80% of participants is _more decentralized_ than a project that only requried 10% to be compromised.

Attackers that wish to "own" the system have a more difficult job the more decentralized a project is. To defend against take-overs, projects need to reach a sufficient level of decentralization, which means minimizing the number of central points of failure and bottlenecks, which can exist in many different places in the system.

The most decentralized a project can be is _fully decentralized_; attackers must compromise _everyone_, and the system can continue to faithfully operate with only one honest actor. These kinds of systems are vanishingly rare and seldom practical; in practice, either a technological or social limiting factor stands in the way of the persuit of secure, decentralized, and scalable systems, so compromise must be made somewhere.

### The Blockchain Trilemma

> The underlying structure of decentralized networks comes with unique challenges as compared to centralized networks. As early as the 1980s, computer scientists developed what’s called the CAP theorem to articulate perhaps the most major of these challenges. According to the CAP theorem, decentralized data stores — of which blockchain is an iteration — can only provide two of three guarantees simultaneously: consistency, availability, and partition tolerance (CAP). In the context of modern distributed networks, this theorem has evolved into the blockchain trilemma. This is the popular belief that public blockchains must sacrifice either security, decentralization, or scalability in their infrastructure.

...

TODO: A similar decision of sorts also effects the SOCIAL layer of the blockchain, where chains must pick between decentralization and centralization in terms of decision making.. maybe add another axis for 'financing', premines, ?

TODO: leaving aside security as a given, blockchains then have a choice of scalability, and decentralization...

### Character Creation

CAP theorem, _The Blockchain Trilemma_ and the various approaches to organizing socially means that all blockchain projects are forced to hedge their bets by 'specializing' into certain classes with a scarse number of 'ability points'. Every project must place itself somewhere in the the space of these dimensions, sacrificing some for others. Much like a video game character, which attributes are selected will define much of a blockchain's character, abilitites and effectiveness in battle.

As we will see, as far as the protocol's attributes and underlying philosophy go, Etheruem Classic has 'maxed-out' it's decentralization and security, intentionality sacrificing scalability so that these other 'skills' can be strengthened. The basic theory is that for a blockchain protocol to scale it's base protocol, it _must_ make trade-offs in decentralization and security, which in the long run is bound to damage the utility and value of the protocol.

Most blockchains today have abandoned the idea of decentralization maximalism in exchange for scalability and/or the benefits of coordinating from a central group. This may well be useful for short term bootstrapping as it allows the funding of extravegant development or marketing budgets, but unless the project tapers-off this dependance on decentralization, which may be impossible due to the incentivisation strucutres it creates, it is exposed to take-over through the capture of this relatively centralized controlling group.

### Sovereign Grade Censorship Resistance

One question that should be asked when evaluating different blockchain projects is "is it decentralized enough?". The answer to this is entirely dependent on the kinds of applications that are intended to run on a given chain, so this question can be reframed as "who would want to stop the applications on my chain from running, and can the chain resist their attempts at censorship?".

For example, in the case of Bitcoin, it's main application is the coin itself; digital scarcity, and the ability to transfer it without censorship. It competes with many currencies and assets, including the US dollar, and therefore must be able to withstand attacks from very powerful entities to persist. It's [predecessors](#TODOs) were able to be shut down by because they had central points of failure; Bitcoin was designed specifically to circumvent this kind of censorship.

In contrast, some blockchains require less censorship resistance, and only intend to, for example, enable the transfer of in-game assets, or have other uncontrovertial use cases. No powerful external forces really _want_ to stop these chains, so censorship resistance isn't a big deal; it may even be seen as a benefit if some central party can override the state of the chain in certain circumstances, so having the whole chain operated by a handful of Authorities (PoA) is acceptable for this use case. In these cases, where the use case is not important enough for well-funded organizations to want to shut them down, it might make sense to sacrifice dencetralization for scalability.

Ethereum Classic, even back in 2015 when it was known as Etheruem, set out to acheive ambitions on a level at least as prone to censorship as Bitcoin.

> Ethereum is a decentralized computing platform that executes smart contracts. Applications are ran exactly as programmed without the possibility of censorship, downtime, or third-party interference.
>
> - Etheruem.org, 2015

Etheruem's Smart Contract Platform was designed to support not just Bitcoin's base currency use case, but _any_ kind of blockchain application, and because of this, it is highly likely that attempts at censorship will be made by incumbants are disrupted.

To provide a solution on a global level that would potentially need to sustain attacks from other sovereign institutions such as nation states and multinationals, Ethereum, like Bitcoin, has to reach a level of decentralization that made it impossible for any of these groups censor it; _Sovereign Grade Censorship Resitance_ is required.

An important threashold is reached with this level of uncensorability; as no other institution can censor the network, applications become significantly more useful, and they becomes trutless; they no longer rely on the permission of some big company or government to operate, and on these platforms, it is the _users_, rather than the _providers_ who get to decide what goes on.

_Code is Law_ can only operate on a chain that has acheived _Sovereign Grade Censorship Resistance_, so that other entities cannot censor it's operation, and this in turn requires the chain to max-out it's decentralized attributes and constantly maintained them without compromise; it reuqires _Decentralization Maximalism_.

## Centralization Failure States

Today, even more so than when Etheruem was launched in 2015, it is increasingly obvious that censorship is becoming the weapon of choice of a dying system that is desperately attempting to cling on to relevance. As these old institutions become increasingly threatened by change, it seems likely that ever-more drastic measures will be taken in an attempt defend their position.

Before blockchain technology entered the scene, these institutions had reality pretty much on lockdown as society was reliant on centralized control points that could be exploited. With cryptography, though, and just in the Nick of time, Satoshi graced us with the answer to this reliance, which has turned the tables on the existing [logic of violence](https://cryptonews.net/en/news/bitcoin/2927549/), and provided humanity with an alternative emergent order.

As time goes on, the attacks against free, fair and open alternatives to the status quo will ramp up. The cryptocurrency ecosystem will enter a new phase, a highly antagonistic phase, where the uncensorability of blockchain technology will truly be put to the test, and the central points of failure in cryptocurrency systems that have them will be sought out and exploited. For use cases that are not approved by incumbants, only the _Soverign Grade_ will survive.

In the future, in order to maintain utility and value, blockchains must be able to resist a range of social, economic and technological attacks will be deployed against them. The list of attacks are ever growing and new forms of attack are likely to be conjured up, but a few of the more obvious potential failure states will be explored below.

### The Ephemeral Foundation

Historically, the number one cause of death for blockchains is when the teams responsible for maintaining it no longer operate. Simply put, if a project depends on a central organizing comittee or developer team, it will only last as long as this organization exists.

Organizations can cease to operate for many reasons; be it a simple rugpull, running out of funds, getting hacked, getting hammered by regulators, traffic accidents, or any other number of reasons, these factors are often outside the control of this team, so it is down to luck or the approval of regualtors as to whether or not a project can survive.

In many cases, the existance of a Foundation disincentivises other teams from contributing to the protocol on a level playing field. Third parties will always be second class citizens compared to this central organizing comitte, who are calling the shots and disproportionately benefitting from price action, which further solidifies reliance on the Foundation to maintain and direct the project, and at the very least prevents a natural organization heirarchy from emerging.

This reliance on a central team may provide direction and big budgets in the short term, but it burdons the protocol with a kind of "centralization debt" that is difficult to pay off. Eventually, like all organizations, the central team will cease to operate, and the project is likely to become either abandoned or maladapted to life without this group.

### Meatspace Capture

For high value projects that have an overreliance on centralized teams, as time goes on, a fate far more insidious than mere abandonment becomes increasingly likely. Like clockwork, as with all top down centralized institutions, they become captured by special interests through various manipulative techniques.

If a powerful institution feels threaterened by a new technology, rather than trying to stamp it out, which may be impossible, it is far more effective to simply compromise and disrupt it's operation by influencing the direction of development in a way that does not fundamentally upset the status quo.

This can be acheived by turning influencers and the leadership of an organization into puppets, who's strings are pulled through a variety of carrots and sticks. Humans are fallable and are suceptible to all degrees of manipulation and blackmail; peer pressure, politics, kickbacks, bribes, psyops, honey traps, kompromat, phyiscal threats, imprisonment, or worse.

With enough key targets under the thumb of an attacker, they are then able to control the future of a chain through their authority, making subtle incremental changes that further increase their grip and control over decision making.

One of the most problematic elements of this type of failure state is that it can be done in a way that is totally undetectable; it may be that the level to which a central team is compromised is unkown, and it only becomes obvious that the chain is captured when it is too late.

Even if a centralized team is not fully compromised, the very potential of this compromise can sow distrust and uneasiness; conspiracy theories and the questioning of decision making may undermine a project's leadership and stability if they appear not to be driven by merit alone, and simple divide and conquer tactics deployed against the organizing comittee may be enough to paralyze the chain.

This failure state shows there is an inherant contradiction within any blockchain project that relies on a central organizing comittees, as it necessatates that these supposedly decentralized projects are in fact depending on a central group that can and will be bent to the will of anyone who feels like the cost of doing so is worth it.

### Proof of Stake: Compromised Consensus

A blockchain's consensus mechanism is it's engine; it is the most critical piece of infrastrucutre, from which all security, value and ultility depends on. Like an engine, if it stops working properly, all other systems that rely on it functioning become useless.

As with autombile engines, different types of consensus mechanisms are available to blockchain architects when designing a protocol, and the choice of which to use reveals much about which attributes in the _Blockchain Trilemma_ tradeoff are considered a priority. As a chain's consensus mechanism is so important, for _Sovereign Grade_ systems, is the very last thing that should be on the chopping board when it comes to design constraints and security trade-offs.

The first blockchain, Bitcoin, uses Proof of Work; a relatively simple, tried and true type of consensus mechanism that essentially converts electricity into security. Proof of Work is both empirically and theoretically secure from an economic game theory perspective, and even in the face of disruption from nation states, history has shown that it stands strong.

An alternative to Proof of Work that became popular is Proof of Stake, which much like a fad, became a "must have" for many new blockchain projects launching after 2015. The primary justification for PoS is environmentalism; it was hoped that it would be able to provide the same or better security guaruntees than PoW without consuming large amounts of energy.

But there is no such thing as a free lunch, and after many years of theorizing and real life experimenting with Proof of Stake systems, the results are in; PoS on a fundamental level cannot come close to matching the security guauntees provided by PoW.

The issues with Proof of Stake are too numerous to dive into detail here, and a seperate article [debunking Proof of Stake](#TODO) is available, but some of the more egregious problems include:

- TODO move this into it's own article.
- Nothing at Stake
- Permissioned
- Rich Get richer
- Race to the bottom inflation (capital liquid compared to hardware)
- etc
- No dispute resolution mechanism
- todo.
- Becuase the default rules of a hard fork are to "Do nothing", this means the defending side of a fork in Proof of Stake requries to do a hardfork to avoid being slashed on the new chain, whereas the new chain can enjoy either slashing or no-slashing options. The major dispute resolution mechanism

Even if the environmentalist argument for Proof of Stake is takens at face value, it is clear that PoS requires chains to sacrifice some of the security guaruntees provided by PoW. In other words, Proof of Stake chains trade away censorship resistence in return for the promise of less carbon emissions. TODO: phrase this nicely; This is bad because it is not the responsibility of a chain to look after the environment.

But it is when the the environmentalist claim is _not_ taken at face value that the choice to use PoS makes a lot more sense. Much like a hotel that requests guests to re-use towels to "save the planet", the PoS environmentalist position is conveniently one that also enriches holders of Proof of Stake currencies, who are able to, without much effort, generate passive income by staking. It is this cynical take that explains why despite the security downgrade, it is no wonder that PoS became such a popular choice.

Because of the inherant trade-offs with Proof of Stake systems, it is clear that _Soveriegn Grade Censorship Resistance_ is not a priority on these chains, and as such, they cannot be recommended for deployments that have the potential to be disrupt powerful incumbant institutions.

### Funny Money

One "feature" centralized systems beware of is the devaluing of holding via inflation.

## Classic Problems Require Classic Solutions

Corruption is a problem as old as civilisation, and whilst it might not have obviously reared it's ugly head in the blockchain space, as the technology becomes more influential, it will attract forces that wish to bridle it's power and shape it towards a future where, far from liberating humanity, it becomes a tool for optimizing enslavement.

Luckily a window of opporunity exists to counter the inevitable ongoing attempts to capture blockchais; for now, projects that strive for _decentrlization maxlimalism_ still exist and are available to those who wish to use them.

While it's still voluntary, rather than relying on authority figures or marketing campaigns, individuals can reason from first principles and reflect on lessons from the past to reach their own conclusions about which blockchains are likely to provide long term value and are worth interacting with. By going "back to the roots" of not just blockchain technology, but Austrian economic theory and ultimately the primatives of reason itself, the wisdom in the designs decisions behind Bitcoin become clear, and this logic can be reappllied to other technological advancements in the space, including Ethereum.

### A Different Kind Of Foundation

History has shown that whilst institutions and the humans that make them are fallible, fickle and fragile, ideas are bulletproof. It it self-evident that a technology as important and influential as blockchain must be built upon something more than just people; it must be backed by a well developed philosophy to guide the actions of otherwise [capturable](#meatspace-capture) bags of meat.

Good ideas stand on their own, can be debated in public, and are true regardless of who proclaims them, which makes them perfect for constructing a harness to restrain and protect the future of a blockchain project. That is why Etheruem Classic's Foundation is not a group, but it's core principles, which come first and inform decision making.

Pragmatism is downstream of maintaining and adhering to good principles, as they are what enable both practical survivability and act as a form of advertising that attracts quality contributors. The _principles first_ appraoch goes a long way to ensuring that a project can maintain it's course for many generations to come, as it is guided not by the ever-changing interests of a central group, but by external philosophical reference points that, even with high a turnover, can be argued in public to direct the future of the project.

Having no central group to call the shots means that any individual or group can fill any role, as long as they are seen to be faithfully interpreting and executing ETC's principles and values, as understood by stakeholders. If some feel that a hard fork diverges from the values they signed up for, they are free to continue the existing version of the chain. The risk of a chain split means all participants are incentivised to work together to solve differences, but neither side can overrule the other if the disagreement is unresolvable.

### Escaping The Gravity Well of Centralization

Centralization is lot like gravity; it is a force constantly tugging on social systems, and without anything to push back, without checks & balances or the correct incentive structures in place, organizations devolve into a default state of _might makes right_; a chimp-like authoritarian heirarchy.

Civilization provides the antitode to this "return to monke" existance in the form of anti-entropic procedures and systems that can form complex social heirarchies that are based not on muscle but on merit.

Incentive structures, like bamboo holding up a tent, have the ability to, if placed correctly, overcome the gravity of centralization. By

The original blockchain, Bitcoin is an example an example of e

In the case of blockchains, these pieces of bamboo can be cleverly placed to create much more elaborate an exciting structures that would otherwise collapse inwards.

When a project attempts to construct a tent with just two of the three key elements, it might hold up for a while, but even the mildest breeze from external forces threatern to cause the house of cards to tumble.

The Tripod of Developers, Miners and Holders keeps things in check, and they prop each other up in cincentive structures to ensure the whole system is far more rigid and _secure_.

Why you can't have decentralization in half measures, and it must be built to last over rtime. The mistake of proof of stake systems is that they have, on paper, a system that can last a lifetime,

_image of someone about to place final card on house of cards and it falls_

So how do you dedign a blockchain that is able to withstand the forces of cetnralization?

- Pillars of decentralization
- All layers must be decentralized
- Minimize or remove single points of failure
- Toxicity as a immune response (vs sowing division)
- meatspace capture immunity
- Eternal vigilance; Systems naturally tend towardss centralization so there must be some counter force always preventing this from happening to keep the system secure. In the long run, only truly decentralized blockchains will survive.
- Even the smallest of infraction or exceptions are intolorable as they will accumulate over time until the system becomes captured; it is about trajectory not absolute position.
- General rule of thumb is decreased complexity is good.
- Single points of failure can exist in many areas and are often hidden.

Even more interesting blockchains that have Smart Contracts built on top of this base layer, with the hope that more ...

You want a situation where you have people in the social layer that are as politiciallly diverse as possible, not in beleifs but in whips. I.e. having too many people who are dependent on britain is bad - and same with alliances. You want chinese and Iraqis and russians and Argentinians and everyehere to counterbalance any influence that an individual from one nation state is going to have.

### Protocol Neutrality & Natural Contribution

Rather than a Foundation consisting of people, some projects have a foundation that is rooted in philosophy; immportal principles rather than temporal bags of flesh. A foundation of ideas rather than people means that for time immemorial _any_ group or individual can fill any role they like, and can so without permission or being directed by any central authority.

For these types of projects, instead of relying on artificial cash injections that are finite and handed out from the top, contributions are financied naturally by a _Buy and Contribute_ strategy. The

Projects that have an overreliance on a central foundation are seldom able to free themselves of this reliance, and do not evolve to be sustainable becauses they are not perceived to be neutral.

- Neturality Niche
- Evolves naturally sustainable development incentives based on meritocracy

- If a foundation runs out of money, is hacked, or simply disappear, an over-reliance on this source of founds will prove to be a hinderance .

Blockchain is a unqiue technology because this coordination problem can be solved through the _Buy and Contribute_ strategy, which incentivises contributions without a central Aritifical source of funding for the project. The overreliance on artificial funding is difficult to detect... blah blah.

When the cash runs out, the development that was reliant on this will disappear, and unlike other chains that never had this artificial cash source, alternative funding models have evolved.

More importantly, what drives deicion making on this new orphaned project? Without a set of guiding principles to follow, it will surely devlolve into a kleptocratic race to the bottom to pillage the corpse of whatever value remains.

## ETH + BTC = ETC

For those already somewhat familiar with the blockchain ecosystem and can distinguish between the two major projects, a quite simple heuristic exists that cuts to the chase of what Ethereum Classic is attempting to acheive.

> Ethereum Classic takes the philosophy of Bitcoin and applies it to the technology of Ethereum
>
> - The CEO of Ethereum Classic, if one existed

Many of those who were involved with Ethereum before the DAO Hack were under the impression that Ethereum was hoping to do exactly this; be built on top of the well-established core ideas that Bitcoin provided, but add on additional functionality in the form of a Turing Complete Smart Contract Platform.

But as The DAO Hack showed, this was not the case; what is now known as Etheruem has very little to do with the decentralist values that Bitcoin was created to embody.

The decision for the Ethereum Foundation to abandon the decetnralist values that were used to entice contributions was unfortunate, but created a vacuum that ultiamtely further refined the meaning and importance of those values and birthed a project who's mission was to explicity continue that original vision.

Ethereum Classic, even more so than Bitcoin itself, exists as an explicit reminder about the importantce of decentralist values. Clearly there were many who didn't quite get their importance at the time, although many others saw the truth that decentralilzation _was_ the point, not just an annoying obstable to overcome.

And so, in the persuit of centralization, Ethereum Clasic recognises the genious decisions made when constructing the original Bitcoin protocol, and has since attempted to emulate this in the persuit of not just decetralization but also the empiricial success that has come from following them.

Ultiamtely, we hope that Ethereum Classic can live up to that original vision of Ethereum: Bitcoin, but with Smart Contracts.

Ethereum was originally supposed to be "Bitcoin, but with Smart Contracts", but when this goal was abandoned, Ethereum Classic merrily continued the vision.

### No Official Anything

Just like Bitcoin, Ethereum Classic has no official developers, maintainers, or leaders. It has no official logo, no official website, no official conferences. Ethereum Clasic _cannot_ have an official _anything_, becuase no individual or group has the authority to claim they represent ETC in any official capacity.

This is a rare quality, and massive strength in the world of blockchains, as it means there is no official _thing_ that can be taken down, captured, or compromised, and there is no official entity that can sue competing forks for copyright enfringement.

_No official anything_ is the source of much of the strength of the Ethereum Classic project, but also has drawbacks as there is no central source of truth to coordinate from. Instead, a do-ocracy exists where anyonee can contribute, and based on what is actually done and what is picked up and used becomes what makes up Ethereum Classic. This makes it a unique project and attractive to contributors; literally nothing can stop _you_ from being as close to official as anyone else.

Some say that Ethereum Classic goes evern more extreme in this type of decentnralization than Bitcoin, which has Satoshi, who could come back one day and begin to make suggestions or guide development in a way that is not purely meroticratic.

### Secure Base Layer

The current consensus within the Ethereum Classic and wide computer sceience community is that the aforementioned _Blockchain Trilemma_ is insurmountable, at least on the base later. For this reason, Ethereum Classic's current roadmap does not include some of the more exotic "solutions" that will be attmpted by Ethereum.

Sharding, is one such example, where contracts are siloed into their own execution environments and can be executed in parralel. In theory this idea seems plausible, but for that added complexity, it is not suitable for globally interoperable contracts, including many of today's useful systems that need shared execution, such as anything that touches DeFi liquidity.

Essentially, there are very few _one size fits all_ approaches to scaling throughput that can be applied on the base layer without compromising an important security assumption, so for ETC as a protocol, it is best left up to applications or secondary protocols to provide various different tradeoffs and implement their own optimizations depending on the use case and the needs of users.

Many in the Ethereum Classic community are also wary of attempts to increase the block size, due to the negative effects that are likely to appear down the road in terms of "bloat" and the increased _time to sync_ and hardware requirements, which if left unchekced may make it difficult to run an Ethereum Classic node, leading to centralization. Some argue the block gas limit should be reduced even further, whilst others look towards _Zero Knowledge Proof_ technologies that can reduce the amount of data needed to be stored on chain.

There is general agreement that a layered approach to scaling blockchains is able to increase throughput while satisfying the _Blockchain Trilemma_ in a way that does not mess with the base layer; individuals are free to experiment with different "L2" systems that provide various tradeoffs depending on the application and user requirements.

### Proof of Work

Another of the technological experiments persued by Ethereum that was rejected by ETC is that of Proof of Stake. As previously [disucssed](#PoS),

- Externally sourced security
- Permissionless
- Less complex attack surface
- Battle tested
- Miner Attrition
- Fair Distribution (rich dont get richer)
- Separation of Responsibilities

How do we prevent this from happening in ETC? by defending our principles.

### Sound Money

Last but not least for the .

- Counters "ultrasound" modern money theory
- Inflation won't happen becasue we've rebranded it.

- It doesn't matter how much you rebrand, the fundamentals are the same. The only way to prevent abuse is to have a pre-agreeed emission schedule.
- Most blockchains at least understand the imporance of having a predefined emisison schedule. Etheruem very toxicly and dangerously suggests that no, all blockchaims have fundamentally infinite inflation. No that's not right.

The decision to implement a hard fork, at least with proof of work, can only be considered succesful the second chain has no value.

- Austrian Economics
- etcis.money

## Conclusion

- ETH is already captured, see: The DAO
- We are just waiting for that capturedness to express itself again

Reasoning from first principles, we arrive at the conclusion that Ethereum Classic is currently humanity's best bet, the rest will succumb to outside pressure, which will exploit any points of centralization

In the the not too distant future, the need for will be all too clear. As blockchain projects one by one reveal their true colors and succum to corruption in the form of capture by special interests, only the truly decentralized will remain.
