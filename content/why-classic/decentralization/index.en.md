How does ETC prevent itself from being captured?

## ETH + BTC = ETC

- We take the best parts of bitcoin and apply them to the best parts of Ethereum
- Technologically and/or Philosophically superior to both projects
- ETH: Smart Contract Platform -- Turing Complete, Built for Developers
- BTC: Fundamentals of Decentralization and Sound Money

## Proof of Work

## Meatspace Capture

## No Leaders

## Sound Money

- Small infractions or exceptions are intolorable as they will accumulate over time until the system becomes captured
