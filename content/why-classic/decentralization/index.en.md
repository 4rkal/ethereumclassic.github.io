How does ETC prevent itself from being captured?

As time goes on and the full scope of blockchain technology becomes apparent, incumbant institutions will do everything within their power to subvert and destroy the new systems that threatern to disintermediate them.

Technological, Economic and Social attacks will be launched against the cryptocurrency space and will be effective against the majority of chains that have failed to anticipate this threat. Ironically, the very reason for blockchains existing is forgotten by the majority of them today, as they abandon the countermeasures that Satoshi Nakamoto handed down.

In the long run, only _truly_ decentralized blockchains will survive.

Ethereum Classic stands among a handful of these kinds of projects.

the rest will succumb to outside pressure, which will exploit any points of centralization

In the the not too distant future, the need for will be all too clear. As blockchain projects one by one reveal their true colors and succum to corruption in the form of capture by special interests, only the _truly_ decentralized will remain.

Ethereum Classic existance is a

Etheruem Classic is one of those survivors.

## ETH + BTC = ETC

- We take the best parts of bitcoin and apply them to the best parts of Ethereum
- Technologically and/or Philosophically superior to both projects
- ETH: Smart Contract Platform -- Turing Complete, Built for Developers
- BTC: Fundamentals of Decentralization and Sound Money

## Proof of Work

- Miner Attrition
- Permissionless
- Fair Distribution
- Nothing at Stake
- Battle Tested
- Separation of Concerns

Ethereum Classic didn't just have a "fair distribution", it had an "ultrafair distribution"; a voluntary market redistribution away from those who didn't want Code is Law to those who supported Code is Law; this process refined the initial hodlers of ETC to be those who would respect and defend it's core values.

## Meatspace Capture

### ConsenSys, Kompromat and Corporate Capture

Let's imagine that one day you happen to be in charge of .

Ask yourself how you'd take down a chain like Ethereum.

Here's a thought experiment. Imagine it's

- Corporate Capture
- ConsenSys
- Kompromat

## No Leaders

Just like Bitcoin, the only real way to get around this problem is to have no no leaders.

## Sound Money

- Small infractions or exceptions are intolorable as they will accumulate over time until the system becomes captured

- Long Term Time Preference
- The Decentralization Spectrum
- Sovereign Grade Censorship Resistance
- Principles over Pragmatism?
- Protocol Neutrality
- Natural vs Artificial Contribution
- Competition for the Neutrality Niche
- The Centralization Gravity Well

- In the future, they will inflict any and all kinds of social attacks systems that attempt to implement parralel institutions
- The onyl way to achieve this is to follow the original ethereum vision of unstoppabile - truly unstobble - applications that are reistant to censorship from any force.
- Today, even more so than 2015, it's increasingly obvious that Censorship is becoming the weapon of choice and will be weilded to protect a dying system
- Whether they realise it or not, _Code is Law_ is a major threat to any vested interests that rely on corruption and rent seeking
- Ethereum mainnet is already captured, and will be cancelled by the powers that be when push comes to shove
