Ethereum Classic's miraciulous origin story will surely be referenced by future crypto historians as a case study that illuminates the sociotechnological fabric of blockchains. Like a Large Hadron Collider experiment, _the incident_ that birthed ETC tore apart what was previously considered a more or less atomic entity, permenantly splitting the Ethereum project in two, and scattering a cascade of valuable insights to observers.

From a purely historical perspective, ETC's story is fascinating and essential reading for any cryptocurrency researcher. But for those who are interested in really understanding what makes blockchains useful and valuable, there is no story more relevant; against all the odds, despite the wishes of many, _Code is Law_ and "Build Unstoppable Applications" ended up prevailing. Through the simple act of persisting, Ethereum Classic validated not just it's own value proposition, but the strength and tenacity of truly decentralized blockchains generally.

## Forgotten Details

In the wider Ethereum community, whilst the existence of Ethereum Classic is reluctantly acknowledged, the important details surrounding it's creation are largely unknown and seldom brought up because they reveal a darker side to the rainbows and unicorns. ETC's origin story is is one of ~~greed, betrayal,~~ TODO the sacrificing of values, but worst of all, in order to justify what happaned, a cultural shift away from _Code is Law_ and as such ETH's abandomnet of the higher purpose of truly decentralized blockchains.

To some who are over-exposed to ETH, the details of this story pose a threat, and this is why Ethereum Classic itself is the target of dismissal, smear and ridicule. But whilst the details of ETC's genesis may be inconvenient, the facts of history must be remembered; it is the details that matter, as they warn about the very real dangers centralization.

As time goes on it will become increasingly clear that those who attack ETC are really attacking a simple truth that reveals an insecurity - that when Ethereum abandoned _Code is Law_, it also abandoned it's long term value propopsition, a proposition that ETC will be around to defend when, once again, Etheruem is bent to the will of special interests.

> Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.

## Blame the Game

With this being said, in many ways Ethereum Classic _is_ Ethereum, and whilst coordination failures may have taken place, there is absolutely no need for ill-will towards anyone involved in or around the nascent stages of Ethereum. Far from it, all of those who contributed to Ethereum, developers and non-developers alike, should be revered for their important work in helping create one of the most important acheivements of our generation.

There are points in this story that may suggest potential financial conflicts of interest, but as it is impossible to determine how much these did or did not play a part, the individuals involved deserve the benefit of the doubt; decisions made at the time were in all likelihood driven by honest disagreement about what the best outcome would be for Ethereum at a time when there very little real world precedent to go by.

The creation of Ethereum Classic was a strange and (at the time) unpredictable outcome, so rather than blaming individuals or groups it may be more accurate to view the birth of Ethereum Classic as a happy accident that the universe saw fit to grace us with.

## The Original Ethereum Vision

In the beginning there was "Build Unstoppable Applications", and for a time it was good. It was a real revolution, as for the first time, your average developer now had the ability to create a new type of software that could not be stoppped or censored by anyone. In the early days, there was a united understanding and support of _Code is Law_ within the Ethereum community; it was was not just unconvovertial, but the very mission of Ethereum.

This is evidenced by tweets from prominent thoughtleaders and Ethereum Foundation staff at the time, and moreover, by the phrase "Build Unstoppable Applications" [appearing on the official Ethereum website](https://web.archive.org/web/20150802035735/https://www.ethereum.org/). The phrase, as we [previously](/why-classic/code-is-law) looked at, is one and the same as _Code is Law_; unstoppability means that contract code is the ultimate arbiter of transaction outcomes, as opposed to courts or other forces outside the network who would otherwise be able to stop applications.

Thousands flocked to the project based on this understanding and contributed time, talent and money, united by the _Original Ethereum Vision_ of "Build Unstoppable Applications". They told their friends, vouched for it's integrity, and thanks to this, the good word of Ethereum spread like wildfire.

Everything was going well in ETH land; people were excited, new ideas were sprouting, projects were launching, and one of those projects in particular was soon to _prove classic_; The DAO.

## The DAO

A DAO or "Decentralized Autonomous Organisation" describes a Smart Contract system that, much like a company, manages the distribution of funds for many stakeholders, and is usually goverened by voting mechanisms. The idea of DAOs had been around for a while but were only theoretical until Ethereum made it easy to program and launch them, which many teams began to in 2015/16.

### Slock.it

Stephan Tual was Ethereum Foundation's Chief Communications Officer; he [announced](https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/07/30/ethereum-launches/) the Genesis Block and was an [advocate](https://twitter.com/stephantual/status/711874685156376576) of Code is Law. Stephan, like many others, saw the bright future promised by "Build Unstoppable Applications", indeed, as CCO of Ethereum, ultimately it was his call to use this term to promote the Ethereum project.

In November 2015, Stephan teamed up with some Ethereum Foundation coders and formed a company called slock.it, and they wanted to launch not just _a_ DAO, but _The_ DAO, that would be used as a kind of Venture Capital fund targeting Etheruem projects. It was pitched as a way to both grow the Ethereum ecosystem and net returns for investors, who would deposit ether into The DAO contract in exchange for DAO Tokens, which would yeild rewards from investments made by The DAO.

### Curators from Ethereum Foundation

The DAO became big news in the Ethereum world, not least because it received significant endorsements from Ethereum Foundation members. Aside from the project being led by Stephan, The DAO had recruited "curators", who were given the ability to veto certain actions and act as a failsafe, in effect reassuring investors that funds would not be at risk. [All 11 curators](https://medium.com/ursium-blog/vitalik-buterin-gavin-wood-alex-van-de-sande-vlad-zamfir-announced-amongst-stellar-dao-curators-44be4d12dd6e#.1mjq6cfn6) had worked for the Ethereum Project or Foundation; including notable heavyweights Vitalik Buterin and Gavin Wood.

### The World's Biggest Crowdsale

At the time, many saw The DAO as a "no risk" investment, as not only did it have trustworthy curators, but investors would be able to withdraw their funds from The DAO in future via a "split" mechanism; this further incentivised contributions as investors could "opt-out" later, but only had one chance to "opt-in" during the initial crowdsale.

Slock.it launched The DAO crowdsale in April 2016, and the ETH began to roll in. But soon there were signs that something wasn't quite right. During the crowdsale, [slock.it announced a security proposal](https://medium.com/ursium-blog/dao-security-a-proposal-to-guarantee-the-integrity-of-the-dao-3473899ace9d), a curator [called for a moratorium](https://hackingdistributed.com/2016/05/27/dao-call-for-moratorium/), and another curator [stepped down](https://gavofyork.medium.com/why-ive-resigned-as-a-curator-of-the-dao-238528fbd447):

> You have been warned ;-)
>
> - Gavin Wood, Ethereum Founder & (Ex) DAO Curator

But despite these warnings, by the time the crowdsale was over, The DAO had raised an incredible $150 million USD worth of ETH, breaking all world records to become the largest crowdsale ever. This USD amount may not sound staggering by today's standards, but it was 14% of all ETH, which would be worth about of $70 billion USD at today's market cap (in December 2021).

### "No Funds At Risk"

About a week after the crowdale ended, a security researcher [publicly disclosed](https://vessenes.com/more-ethereum-attacks-race-to-empty-is-the-real-deal) a new type of vulnerability that many Smart Contract developers had previously not really thought about; the so-called "reentrancy bug".

The bug can occur when a contract does not properly update it's own state when other contracts interact with it, allowing attackers to execute the same function many times over against the _intent_ of the contract's authors. It's a bit like a vending machine that does not check that a coin was properly inserted; an attacker can tie a piece of string around the coin to pull it back out, and use the same coin to sweep all the delicious goodies.

Becuase Ethereum was so new and best practices hadn't formed around developing Smart Contracts, this bug was quite common; once the news got out, many contracts were exploited and funds were lost. Luckily, [The DAO was not affected](https://medium.com/ursium-blog/no-dao-funds-at-risk-following-the-ethereum-smart-contract-recursive-call-bug-discovery-29f482d348b), according to slock.it.

Unfortunately, a few days later it turned out that The DAO was affected by the reentrancy bug after all. One or more attackers began to drain The DAO, and just like a piece of string tied to a coin, used specially crafted contracts to repeatedly call The DAO's split function to extract away more ETH than it's contract authors _intended_ to allow.

### Altering the Deal

A very important point to note here is that The DAO Hacker did not exploit anything in the underlying Ethereum protocol itself as the exploit was limited to the The DAO contract. They also did not "break the rules" of the The DAO either; they simply interacted with The DAO in a way that it's authors did not anticipate. Regardless of the _intent_ of it's author's, [The DAO's Terms](http://web.archive.org/web/20160501124801/https://daohub.org/explainer.html) made it clear that the contract code itself is the final arbiter; _Code is Law_:

> The terms of The DAO Creation are set forth in the smart contract code existing on the Ethereum blockchain at 0xbb9bc244d798123fde783fcc1c72d3bb8c189413. Nothing in this explanation of terms or in any other document or communication may modify or add any additional obligations or guarantees beyond those set forth in The DAO’s code. Any and all explanatory terms or descriptions are merely offered for educational purposes and do not supercede or modify the express terms of The DAO’s code set forth on the blockchain; to the extent you believe there to be any conflict or discrepancy between the descriptions offered here and the functionality of The DAO’s code at 0xbb9bc244d798123fde783fcc1c72d3bb8c189413, The DAO’s code controls and sets forth all terms of The DAO Creation.

> ...

> By Creating DAO tokens through interaction with The DAO’s smart contract code, you expressly agree to all of the terms and conditions set forth in that code. If you do not understand or do not agree to those terms, you should not Create DAO tokens.
>
> ...
>
> The DAO’s smart contract code governs the Creation of DAO tokens and supercede any public statements about The DAO’s Creation made by third parties or individuals associated with The DAO, past, present and future.

> The field of Digital Cryptography is very new and for this reason, there is a risk of unforeseen attack both in terms of the underlying cryptographic protocol that back the functioning of the DAO as well as 'game theory' related vectors which have not been documented to date. Both these vectors represent a risk that could lead the loss of DAO tokens or ETH in one or more or even all of the DAO Token Holder’s accounts.

Many share the perspective that investors in The DAO, having agreed to the above terms, were aware of the risks involved, and as such, just as they were happy to accept the upside that these risks might reward, must also have been willing to accept the downside concequences of those risks being realized. Unfortunately, for many The DAO Token Holders, this was not the case.

## The DAO Wars

In a ridiculous twist of fate that puts Hollywood to shame, the DAO's split function had a time delay, meaning that The DAO Hacker would be unable to fully extract their loot until about a month after the initial attack took place - assuming that nothing prevented them from doing so in the meantime.

This provided a window of opportunity for the Ethereum community to fight back against the Hacker and figure how they could

Many options were on the table, including those that do not violate _Code is Law_ principles, but also some that do.

### We need Solutions

Todo

#### Hack the Hacker

- Basically, the funds would have been able to recovered eventually. At the very worse, and 70% of the funds were already secured, and the remaining 30% would be temporary locked in a stalemate that would eventually cause the hacker to be forced to reveal their identity.

#### Soft Fork

TEst

#### Hard Fork

Test

that forced a decision on the Ethereum community

### Too Big To Fail

By the time The DAO launched and started raising funds in the form of ETH, the phrase "Build Unstoppable Applications" was promoted to being used as [Ethereum's slogan](http://web.archive.org/web/20160708173558/https://www.ethereum.org/).

- The DAO;
- Many influentual players were over exposed
- Too Big To Fail
- The Hack
- Show the ironic nature of "the terms of the agreement are the contract itself"
- Betraying principles,

Stefan Tual, COO of Ethereum Foundation

## Ethereum's Darkest Hour

To the surprise of many, Ethereum decided.

https://twitter.com/stephantual/status/743764898316877824

- Many lies propoagated at the time, includingn that without a fork Ehereum would be destroyed (No PoS)
- Privatesed profits, socialised losses
- Moral Hazard, Bailouts, Non DAO participants suffered
- More details, link to Bitmex article
- Ethereum Chose to Go down the Route of "Build Stoppable Applications"

- It wasn't a "rollback" - it was worse. It was a "surgical irregular state change" - an attempt to stop the unstoppable.

The debate ensued...

### Dox The Heretics

Particularly ironic, as The DAO...

All is not lost, however. The split function requires about a month until the funds are able to be fully extracted. to the nature of the "split" function,

At this point.

- No Fork
- Soft Fork
- Hard Fork

## The DAO Fork

## The Immaculate Conception

- SO MANY things had to happen perfectly
- If there was no DAO
- If there was no Bug
- If there was no Hacker
- If there was no Split Function with time delay
- etc...
- If it can happen once it can happen again
- No Satoshi, No Leaders, Just Raw Philosophy
- Declaration of Indpendance + The Manifesto
- Code is Law cannot be forked away!

- ETH still pretends to follow Code is Law, even though some of their thought leaders realize this is a contradtiction

## The Philosophical Fallout

To the layman, Ethereum is and has marketed itself all about code being the final arbiter of contract interactions. All of the marketing around decentralization, the DeFi ecosystem, "unstoppable" domains, etcetera, rests on top of this flawed assumption.

In reality, as we have seen, Ethereum's history suggests that this is mere lip service. The inherant contradiction of it's past actions means that the main Ethereum project is now in a schizophrenic position where it is simultaneously be for and against the idea of _Code is Law_. Ethereum cannot take a confident position on this point, and to this day resorts to strategic ambiguity.

Some Etherians say that The DAO Fork was a one-off that will never happen again; Ethereum really does follow _Code is Law_, or at least it does from now on. Others in Ethereum Foundation say that _Code is Law_ is an [inhumane](https://twitter.com/VladZamfir/status/936029138623774721), [sociopathic](https://medium.com/@Vlad_Zamfir/my-intentions-for-blockchain-governance-801d19d378e5) concept; that future DAO Fork level "corrections" _are_ on the table and that is a good thing.

Whichever position is taken, there major problems that remain. By the way, why do influential members of Ethereum Foundation think this position is sociopathic, and does this fact not suggest that they _would_ be willing and able to override _Code is Law_?

This is the double-bind that Ethereum finds itself in and will be the root of it's failure; it cannot square the circle of it's past actions contradicting it's messaging, and this dangling thread tempts the kitten of fate the longer it remains unpulled.

This is this core reason why Ethereum Classic, being openly advocating for the principle of _Code is Law_ in all circumstances, can remain philosophically internally consistent and therefore stand the test of time.

### Build Stoppable Applications

In 2017 researcher and philosophical thought-leader Vlad Zamfir of Ethereum Foundation [admitted](https://twitter.com/VladZamfir/status/930590981816180737) that the phrase should have been "Build _Almost_ Unstoppable Applications". Whilst a full debate about the difference between "Stoppable", "Almost Unstoppable" and "Unstopppable" deserves it's own blog post, for now we will just point out that "Almost Unstoppable" is not the same as "Unstoppable".

Despite this, the phrase "Build Unstoppable Applications" remained as Ethereum's main slogan [until mid 2019](http://web.archive.org/web/20190415163751/https://www.ethereum.org/), when the website was [updated](http://web.archive.org/web/20190511071935/https://ethereum.org/) and this original vision was officially retired.

Thanks to Ethereum Classic, the original messaging did turn out to be accurate in claiming unstoppability; on ETC, The DAO was not stopped, so in the end the promises made on Ethereum.org were kept - just not by it's authors.

## Lessons Learned

- ETC has founders, but has no founders.
- Moreso than bitcoin, who's ultimate , ETC embodies the principles of bitcoin in a more explicit way.
- ETC has no satsohi

### Privatized Profits, Socialized Losses

In a textbook definition of [moral hazard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_hazard), the Hard Fork created

- Not necessary, funds would be recovered
- Overall we're very glad it happened
- If they knew it would cause a chain split, it would probably not happen

## History Repeats

How do we prevent this from happening in ETC? by defending our principles.
