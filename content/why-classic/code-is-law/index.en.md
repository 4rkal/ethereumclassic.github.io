# Code is Law

For Ethereum Classic, principles come first, and ETC's story begins with a phrase that most succinclty captures it's philosophy; _Code is Law_.

_Code is Law_ is what puts the "Unstoppable" in "Build Unstoppable Applications", a philosophy that was lauded enthusiastly by Ethereum up until _the incident_. But what does _Code is Law_ actually mean, and why did Etherians outside of Ethereum Classic suddenly decide to abandon it?

## A Vision for the Future

Many who think deeply about the potential of blockchain technology have a "eureka" moment, where it all _clicks_, and the wild valutations of the cryptocurrency space sudenly feel a little meager. They realise that it is possible for a future to exist where all agreements between people are ultimately goverened not by corruptible institutions but by the cold hard logic of Smart Contract code.

In this future, individuals decide for themselves which contracts they wish to engage with, rather than by the roll of the dice via the monopolies they happen to be born into. There are no middlemen, as rent-seeking in all areas is replaced by disintermediation, market competition, and price optimisation. This reality is fairer, cheaper, interoperable, and global. It becomes a universal solvent that melts away the speleothem of old.

In this future a new era of human flourishing is unleashed, as society is unshackled from the inefficiency and opacity of corruption and regulatory capture. It will be nothing short of a new renaissance, a beaming ray of hope in the face of darker alternatives, and to top it off, it is acheivable within our lifetimes.

## Vitrual Jurisdictions

In this future, one or more global "virtual jurisdictions" exist, over and above (and possibly instead of) the traditional geography-based legal frameworks that operate today. These new jurisdictions will be preferred as they offer something their alternatives cannot provide consistently: transparency, fairness and uncorruptability.

Unlike the traditional legal jurisdiction that exist today that are regularly manipulated by the whims of the powerful, future virtual jursidictions will be goverened by the principle of "Code is Law", meaning that for the first time ever, humanity can operate under _actual_, as opposed to the guise of, Rule of Law, codified not in archane and misinterpretable legal prose, but in pure mathematics.

_Code is Law_ is made possible by blockchain tech, and is a simple concept that keeps these jurisdictions sovereign; it means that the code of a Smart Contract is the ultimate arbiter of the outcome of an on-chain interaction, as opposed to some overriding force from outside the network.

When individuals voluntarily engage with Smart Contracts on a chain that follows _Code is Law_, they accept the outcome of whatever logic is defined within those contracts. If a contract is poorly written or has a mistake, it is not the responsibility of the wider network to "make whole" parties who are not happy with a given outcome. In short: No do-overs.

## The Value of Blockchains

Upon reflection, it becomes apparent that _Code is Law_ is really the _only_ way that Smart Contracts can be fairly or usefully intepreted. If a blockchain does not uphold _Code is Law_, then then outcome of transactions is not goverened by individual choice via contract code, but ultimately by "governance" from the legacy system, including all the drawbacks that the introduction of a blockchain was meant to alleviate.

For those that want to "Build Unstoppable Applications", the obvious truth is that _Code is Law_ is the very thing that makes blockchains valuable; it is why they exist. Without _Code is Law_, why bother with a blockchain at all?

## Not without a Fight

Whilst these new systems will unlock immense value for the vast majority, they are bound to be opposed by those who currently benefit from the status quo.

In transparent and uncorruptable _Code is Law_ jurisdictions, those who are unable to provide real value on a level palying field will go extinct. For this reason, in a futile attempt to stop progress, it is likely that truly decentralized blockchains will experience significant pushback from incumbant institutions for whom this better reality poses an existential threat.

If history is anything to go by, attempts will be made to stifle adoption of these empowering new technologies. Projects that are not sufficiently decentralized - those that are not _Sovereign Grade_ - will become captured by the very institutions they promise to disrupt. This is why _Code is Law_ (and the high degree of decentralization that is required to underpin it) must be the primary goal of blockchains that wish to survive and provide value long term.

## Where Code isn't Law

The vast majority of blockchains projects today do not give much priority to _Unstoppability_, _Decentralization_ or _Code is Law_, and are therefore unable to deliver on the bright future alluded to above.

Chains that do not care about _Code is Law_ may certainly carve out niches in areas that won't shake things up too much, but the moment they pose a threat to powerful incumbants, they will be easily manipulated, captured or otherwise compromised, and will therefore ultimately fail to deliver seriously monumental change.

Sadly, this is true for ETC's younger sibling Ethereum; a project that once shared these principles, but after only a year, split away, rebooting a new chain with new rules, going down a new path, and explicitly disavowing _Code is Law_.

To understand what happened, we must now reflect on Ethereum Classic's shared history with Ethereum and revisit _the incident_ that led to ETC's genesis...
