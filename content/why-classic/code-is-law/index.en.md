seo: An explanation of the concept of "Code is Law", and how Ethereum Classic is one of the few blockchain projects that allow this bright future to unfold.
---

## Key Points

- Blockchain Technology and Smart Contracts have the potential to unlock a new era of human flourishing.
- _The_ value that Smart Contract Platforms introduce is _Code is Law_; the ability to _Build Unstoppable Applications_.
- Change is likely to disrupt powerful institutions, who will fight against technology that threatens their position.
- Only blockchains that are committed to _Code is Law_, are suitable to take on this challenge, as they will otherwise be captured.
- Today, most blockchains projects, including Ethereum™, are not committed to _Code is Law_, undermining their value proposition.
- _Code is Law_ is not something to be afraid of, and should be engaged with positively and taken advantage of.

## Introduction

For Ethereum Classic, principles come first, and ETC's story begins with a phrase that most succinctly captures its core philosophy; _Code is Law_.

_Code is Law_ is what puts the "Unstoppable" in "Build Unstoppable Applications", a philosophy that was lauded enthusiastically by The Ethereum Project up until _the incident_. But what does _Code is Law_ actually mean, and why did Etherians outside of Ethereum Classic decide to abandon it?

## A Vision for the Future

Many who think deeply about the potential of blockchain technology have a "eureka" moment, where it all _clicks_, and the wild valuations of the cryptocurrency space suddenly feel a little meager. They realize that it is possible for a future to exist where all agreements between people are ultimately governed not by corruptible institutions but by the cold hard logic of Smart Contract code.

In this future, individuals decide for themselves which contracts they wish to engage with, rather than by the roll of the dice via the monopolies they happen to be born into. There are no middlemen, as rent-seeking in all areas is replaced by disintermediation, market competition, and price optimization. This reality is fairer, cheaper, interoperable, and global. It becomes a universal solvent that melts or lubricates the calcified machinery of old.

In this future a new era of human flourishing is unleashed, as society is unshackled from the inefficiency and opacity of corruption and capture. It will be nothing short of a new renaissance, a beaming ray of hope in the face of darker alternatives, and to top it off, it is achievable within our lifetimes.

## Virtual Jurisdictions

In this future, one or more global "virtual jurisdictions" exist, over and above (and possibly instead of) the traditional geography-based legal frameworks that operate today. These new jurisdictions will be preferred as they offer something their alternatives cannot provide consistently: transparency, fairness and incorruptibility.

Unlike the traditional legal jurisdictions that exist today that are regularly manipulated by the whims of the powerful, future virtual jurisdictions will be governed by the principle of _Code is Law_, meaning that for the first time ever, humanity can operate under _actual_, as opposed to the guise of, Rule of Law, codified not in arcane and misinterpretable legal prose, but in pure mathematics.

_Code is Law_ is made possible by blockchain tech, and is a straightforward concept that keeps these virtual jurisdictions sovereign; it simply means that the code of a Smart Contract is the ultimate arbiter of the outcome of an on-chain interaction, as opposed to some overriding force from outside the network; _applications_ are _unstoppable_, and run exactly as programmed without downtime, censorship or third party interference.

When individuals voluntarily engage with Smart Contracts on a chain that follows _Code is Law_, they accept the outcome of whatever logic is defined within those contracts. If a contract is poorly written or has a mistake, it is not the responsibility of the wider network to "make whole" parties who are not happy with a given outcome. In short: No do-overs, no bailouts, no refunds (unless pre-programmed).

## The Value of Blockchains

Upon reflection, it becomes apparent that _Code is Law_ is really the _only_ way that Smart Contracts can be fairly or usefully interpreted. If a blockchain does not uphold _Code is Law_, then the outcome of transactions is not governed by individual choice via contract code, but ultimately at the behest of "governance" from the legacy system, including all the drawbacks that the introduction of a blockchain was meant to alleviate.

For those that want to "Build _Unstoppable_ Applications", the obvious truth is that _Code is Law_ is the very thing that makes blockchains valuable; it is why they exist. Without _Code is Law_, there are much more efficient ways to "Build _Stoppable_ Applications" (like Amazon Web Services), so why bother with a blockchain at all?

## Not without a Fight

Whilst these new systems will unlock immense value for the vast majority, they are bound to be opposed by those who currently benefit from the status quo.

In transparent and incorruptible _Code is Law_ jurisdictions, those who are unable to provide real value on a level playing field will go extinct. For this reason, in a futile attempt to stop progress, it is likely that truly decentralized blockchains will experience significant pushback from incumbent institutions for whom this fairer reality poses an existential threat.

If [history](https://www.eff.org/wp/riaa-v-people-five-years-later) is anything to go by, attempts will be made to stifle adoption of these empowering new technologies. Projects that are not sufficiently decentralized - those that are not _Sovereign Grade_ - will become captured by the very institutions they promise to disrupt. This is why _Code is Law_ (and the high degree of decentralization that is required to underpin it) must be the primary goal of blockchains that wish to survive and provide value long term.

## Where Code isn't Law

The concept of _Code is Law_ is potentially quite provocative and disruptive to the existing global order, but it need not be reflexively rallied against. Like all powerful technologies, _how and where_ they are applied determines who benefits from their application. Like the internet that came blockchain, the genie is out of the bottle and will certainly change the existing landscape, but by engaging with the technology in a positive way, society can and will adjust.

How we engage depends on recognizing the boundaries of _Code is Law_, and understanding that, like the embers of a fire, for now, it can only exist in unique circumstances, and has to be nurtured and matured into the raging source of light it has the potential to become.

### The Old World

The phrase isn't _Only Code is Law_, and the concept of _Code is Law_ is ambivalent about how any particular local constabulary handles the unstoppability of Smart Contracts in their off-chain jurisdiction. Cryptocurrency theft, for example, is considered illegal in many geographies, and _Code is Law_ proponents can consistently support the returning of stolen funds whilst also not wanting to allow malicious transactions to be reversed via protocol meddling; this is an off-chain concern that is outside the responsibility of the chain, whose role is to ensure that transactions are _not_ reversible through third part interference with the protocol.

_Code is Law_ blockchains, then, are opt-in systems with off-chain consequences that depend on how they are used. In the same way that fire can be used to both provide warmth and destroy things, as a new technological primitive, restricting its use will only hinder the restrictor, who will be left behind as others take advantage of it. There is no question that a big challenge exists in figuring out how the world interfaces with this new tech, but that depends on cultural proclivities and is not the job of technologist; please, don't shoot the messenger.

### Outside the Contract Layer

A common misconception about _Code is Law_ is that it is supposed to apply to all parts of a blockchain's technology stack, including the code of the clients themselves. This is non-sensical, as blockchain clients themselves are written in traditional programming languages and operate in traditional execution environments, where code couldn't be law if it wanted to. Rather, blockchain clients are written to participate in a given blockchain's _protocol_, who's operation creates a new decentralized execution environment; a _Contract Layer_ that sits on top, where _Code is Law_ can operate.

### 9 out of 10 Chains

Some chains have abandoned the idea of _Code is Law_ entirely, indeed, the vast majority of blockchain projects today do not give much if any priority to _Unstoppability_, _Decentralization_ or _Censorship Resistance_, and are therefore unable to deliver on the bright future alluded to above. These projects may certainly carve out niches in areas that won't shake things up too much, but the moment they pose a threat to powerful incumbents, they will be easily manipulated, captured or otherwise compromised, and will therefore ultimately fail to deliver seriously monumental change.

### Big Sis

Sadly, this is true for ETC's younger, albeit weightier sibling, Ethereum™; a project that once shared these principles, but after only a year, split away, rebooting a new chain with new rules, going down a new path, and explicitly disavowing _Code is Law_.

To understand what happened, we must now reflect on Ethereum Classic's shared history with Ethereum and revisit _the incident_ that led to ETC's genesis...
