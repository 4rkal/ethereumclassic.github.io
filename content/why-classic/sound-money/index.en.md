### Unsound Money

Be it fiat or crypto currencies, redistribution of funds via infaltion or currency debasement is one of the oldest tricks in the book for meddling central planners with a misplaced authority. They inevtiably use this mechanism to ensure that when the ship goes down, those who control the keys to the castle will be the first on the life rafts, as they are able to redistribute whatever dregs of value remain to themselves at the expense of holders - for their own safety, of course.

This failure failrue state is a type of rugpull that can only exist in projects that are not sufficiently decentralized, as the redistribution of value away from holders to some specific group (be it miners, stakers or devleopers) can only happen when the [balance of power](#TODO-gravity) is uneven, and some participants are able to push through changes to the protocol that put their interests before others.

Sound money, or it's ability to hold value over time, is a core property of the inventivisation mechanisms that encourage participation, as whilst it does not guaruntee that an asset will appreciate in value, it at least provides a means to calculate future earnings potential given the future growth of a project, and it does guaruntee that holders will benefit fairly from a project's upside.

For blockchain projects, one of the required properites for sound money is that of a known future supply; a.k.a. a fixed emisson curve, where both the protocol and the social layer are programmed to only accept a predefined block reward, which limits inflation. A know future supply means that no group can gain the power to meddle with inflation or debase the currency, and any hard fork that attempts to do so will surely result in a chain split, which staves off attempts do so as it will be highly risky, may be fruitless, and will always result in a version of the chain that does not implement the change.

Some projects do not have a known future supply, which means the risk of Zimbabwe-like hyperinflation is an ever-present dark cloud that hangs over all holders of the currency. For whatever reason in the future, be it development funding issues or the race to the bottom of competing with other chian's proof of stake yeilds, the central organizing comittee of such projects just need to conjour up some justification that inflating away value from holders is simply the only way the project to continue, while ensuring that any significant influencers get paid off.

Some promoters even gaslight their fellow holders into believing that the checks and balances of a fixed future supply is actually a bad thing. In a cynical and orewellean attempt to trick innocent holders into holding an asset that is potentially far _less_ sound than it's known-future-supply alternatives, the idea of _ultrasound money_, a synonym of _unsound money_, simply means that the future supply of a currency is unknown; the emission curve is subject to tinkering based on some undefined and unpredictable critera, meaning it's central organizing reserves the right to rob holders in the future.

### Sound Money

The backbone of strong economies, the provider of stability, the incentiviser of long term time preference, the creator of prosperity. Sound Money is the antitode to many of the problems created by the abuses of centralization in the wider world, and is the core concept that spurred on the creation of Bitcoin.

It is from the [Austrian School of Economics](https://mises.org/topics/bitcoin) that many of the theories behind Bitcoin, including [Sound Money](https://mises.org/library/principle-sound-money), saw their philosophical gestation. Decades before Bitcoin was technologically conceivable, economists suchas Ludwig von Mises, Fredreick Hayak and Milton Friedman were professing the dangers of fiat money and advantage of systems of finance that are free from manipulation by central authorities.

It was identified that for economies to function over time, their monetary unit must be able to act as a reliable medium of exchange and store of value, by exhibiting the following [properties](https://cryptowhat.com/properties-of-sound-money/), which were intentionally engineered into the design of Bitcoin, and inherited by ETC:

- Divisibility: ETC is divisible up to 18 decimal places. This means that ETC can be split into 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 smaller units if needed. Denominations of ETC can be written in wei, the smallest ETC unit currently available.
- Transferability: Since ETC isn’t tied to any banks or governments, it’s easily transferable across countries and between users on a global scale. This gives ETC an advantage over paper money and precious metals, which aren't as easily transferable across long distances.
- Fungibility: Each ETC is worth exactly what it’s valued at on the market. One ETC won’t have different values based on previous ETC transactions—unlike some currencies where older bills are often worth less than newer ones. This is called fungibility, and it’s a property ETC shares with physical commodities like gold and silver.
- Durability: ETC is incredibly durable. It is ultimately just information, so it can be stored on a computer or in a digital wallet, or even offline on a piece of paper or metal. This makes ETC much more durable than traditional forms of money like paper currency which can be easily destroyed or lost.
- Portability: ETC is highly portable. You can carry it on a thumb drive, phone,write it down on paper, or just remember it as a seed phrase!
- Scarcity: ETC has a finite supply which will be released over time. This makes ETC more scarce than most other forms of currency.

ETC has all of the properties of sound money. It’s decentralized, free from political influence and banking regulations, divisible, transferable, fungible, durable and scarce.

The cornerstone of a blockchain's sound monetary policty is scarcity via a _fixed emission curve_. Just like Bitcoin, but [unlike Ethereum](#unsound-money), Ethereum Classic has a _known future supply_, which means that holders of ETC can accurately calculate the total amount of ETC in existence at any point in time; past, present and future.

A fixed emissions curve means that the rate of inflation is predictable and continually decreasing over time. As the value of the network increases, the value of all ETC increases according to this rate, rather than some unknown future rate that could be much higher.

ETC's commitment to a fixed emission curve is enshrined into both the protocol and it's social layer, and thanks to Proof of Work, any hard fork that attempts to manipulate inflation will result in a permenant chain split, massively disincentivising such a change to the point of it being _extremely_ unlikely to be contemplated, let alone attempted, let alone succesful.

In the context of blockchains, a _known future supply_ not only provides a prosperous alternative to the legacy fiat system, but also a critical technical role in the systems that utilise it, as the basis for keeping a project decentralized. The monetary policy of a blockchain is a common agreement that all participants voluntary engage with, and it what keeps all parties aligned economically and prevents any groups from accumulating undue influence over others; it's unwavering neutrality is what keeps all participants on an equal footing.
