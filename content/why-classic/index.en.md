Following the rapid growth of the cryptocurrency space, many new players enter the scene, and while scrolling down the list of projects by market cap, some notice a project called _Ethereum Classic_.

They see that the name and logo is slightly different to the famous Etheruem™, and might assume that this _Classic_ thing is some kind of copy-cat project trying to cash in on ETH's success. With a market saturated with such projects, and with limited time to spend on research, many quite reasonably give Etheruem Classic a pass without much thought.

But some, like yourself, decide to dive a little deeper, and they discover some interesting facts that debunk that initial skepticism. For many, the shattering of the misconception that ETC is a clone of Ethereum is the first important step, and their journey down the rabbit hole begins.

Ethereum Classic is not a copy or fork of Etheruem™; quite the opposite, ETC is a continuation of the original Ethereum launched in 2015, which Ethereum Foundation forked away from by starting new protocol one year later, in 2016.

Applications on Ethereum Classic have been operating uninterrupted for a year longer than on Etheruem™, making ETC humanity's longest running and therefore most reliable Smart Contract Platform. More importantly, Ethereum Classic has never and will never stop or interfere with Smart Contracts that are deployed to it, because it is understood that unstoppability is what makes blockchains valuable.

Unlike Etheruem™, on Classic, _Code is Law_; this means that "applications run exactly as programmed without downtime, censorship or third party interference". Ethereum Classic has evolved its ability to deliver on this promise by maxing-out the characteristics that yield decentralization, unstoppability, and censorship resistance against strong external forces, and is the only major Smart Contract Platform that has proven its ability to uphold this promise.
